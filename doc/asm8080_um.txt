1	Introduction to the assembler

1.1	Calling the assembler

The assembler is called by entering a line of the form:

	asm8080 <file> [<options>]

Where asm8080 represents the filename of the assembler, <file>	is the name
of the source file to be assembled, and [<options>] represents zero or
more assembler option specifiers.  The assembler's assembly language
input file is expected to have a filename extension; if none is explicitly
specified, a filename extension of the form .asm is assumed.

2	Assembler description

2.1	Assembler options

Assembler options are listed and described below.

-h
	Display the help screen.

-I<dir>
	Add directory to the include file search path.
	Notes: Path delimiter is not mandatory, at end of <dir>.

-l<filename>
	This option specifies that <filename> is the name of the file
	in which the assembler's output listing is to be placed.  The
	default is to place the output listing in a file having the
	same name as the input file, but with the filename extension
	.lst appended.

-o<filename>
	This option allows the user to explicitly name the output
	object files, and assigns the name <filename> to them.  If this
	option is not specified, the object files will have the same
	name as the input file, but with the filename extension
	.bin and .hex appended.  If the <filename> assigned via this
	option have a file name extension, this filename extension
	will be ignored.

-P
	Print instruction number of cycles in listing file.
	Instruction number of cycles is printed following the source
	line number.

-v
	Display assembler version.

2.2	Assembler directives

Supported assembler directives are:

	ORG
	END

	INCLUDE

	DB
	DW
	DS

	IF
	ELSE
	ENDIF

	MACRO
	ENDM

	EQU
	SET

2.3	Symbols

A symbol can contain 1 to 64 alphabetic or numeric characters.
Notes: Legacy assembler have a range of 1 to 6 characters.

The first character must be alphabetic.

2.4	Operators

2.4.1	Standard operators

Supported standard operators are:

	+
	-
	*
	/

	<
	>
	=

	LOW
	HIGH

	MOD

	SHL
	SHR

	EQ
	NE
	LT
	LE
	GT
	GE

	NOT		Bitwise NOT (one's complement)
	AND		Bitwise AND
	OR		Bitwise OR
	XOR		Bitwise XOR

2.4.2	Extended operators

Supported extended operators are:

	~		Bitwise NOT

	&
	&&

	|
	||

	^		Bitwise XOR

	==

	>=

	<=

	<<
	>>

2.5	Delimiters

	&	Delimit macro prototype text or formal parameters for
		concatenation.
		(Not supported).

	!	An escape character used to pass the following character as
		part of a macro parameter when the character might otherwise
		be interpreted as a delimiter.

3	Assembler particularities

3.1	Expression parser

Expression parser evaluate the expression linearly, and there is no
priority on operators.
So, it is important to use parentheses to set the order the expression
must be evaluated.

Example:
	4 + 7 * 8

	Will be evaluated as:

	4 + 7	= 11
	11 * 8	= 88

	If you want multiplication be done first, you must add parenthesis
	like below:

	4 + (7 * 8)

   	Will be evaluated as:

	4 + (	= 4
	7 * 8	= 56
  	)	= 60

This expression parser particularity is known to cause problems when
assembling some programs.
