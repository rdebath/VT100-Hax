1	Introduction to the assembler

1.1	Assembler command line

The assembler is called by entering a line of the form:

	asm8080 <file> [<options>]

Where asm8080 represents the filename of the assembler, <file>	is the name
of the source file to be assembled, and [<options>] represents zero or
more assembler option specifiers.  The assembler's assembly language
input file is expected to have a filename extension; if none is explicitly
specified, a filename extension of the form .asm is assumed.

1.2	Assembler options

Assembler options are listed and described below.

-h
	Display the help screen.

-I<dir>
	Add directory to the include file search path.
	Notes: Path delimiter is not mandatory, at end of <dir>.

-l<filename>
	This option specifies that <filename> is the name of the file
	in which the assembler's output listing is to be placed.  The
	default is to place the output listing in a file having the
	same name as the input file, but with the filename extension
	.lst appended.

-o<filename>
	This option allows the user to explicitly name the output
	object files, and assigns the name <filename> to them.  If this
	option is not specified, the object files will have the same
	name as the input file, but with the filename extension
	.bin and .hex appended.  If the <filename> assigned via this
	option have a file name extension, this filename extension
	will be ignored.

-v
	Display assembler version.
