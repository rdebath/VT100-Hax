-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		24 December 2010
By:		Claude Sylvain

		  modularization process.
		- Error is displayed when attempting to use 16-bit
		  operand with "IN/OUT".
		- Removed "ENDLOCAL", because this was not implemented,
	     	  and is not a standard Intel 8080 assembler directive.	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		25 December 2010
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.0

Notes:		- Now, there is 2 keywords table.  One for the assembler

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		27 December 2010
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		28 December 2010
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.0

Notes:		- In "opcode.c", completion of over range check on 16-bit
		  value.
		- In "opcode.c", done some optimisation.
		- Now, on error/warning, file name is displayed/printed,
		  and line number is relative to that file :-)
		- Now, "INCLUDE" support both file name with or without
	      	  quotes :-)
	  	- Fixed a parenthesis evaluation bug in expression
      		  evaluator ("rpn.c", "rpn()").
		- Fixed a problem that make expression evaluator unable
	      	  to evaluate chained expression like:
	  		1-1-1-1-1-1

Date:		31 December 2010
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.0

Notes:		- A "jam" bug resolved in "rpn.c", "extract_byte()".
		- Following problem has been resolved:
			- When an empty source file is included, i8080-as
			  jam.
			- When source file have not and "END" directive,
			  i8080-as jam.
		- Now, the "END" directive is optional.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		1 January 2011
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.0

Notes:		- "-I" (Include) option implemented :-)
		- Done some correction on how "equation" is parsed in some
		  opcode process.  This have fixed a lot of problem :-)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		2 January 2011
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.0

Notes:		- Renamed "rpn.c/h" module as "exp_parser.c/h", since
		  the expression parser is not a RPN (Reverse Polish Notation)
   		  expression parser, but a DAL (Direct Algebraic Logic)
   		  expression parser.
		- In "exp_parser.c", now, parenthesis are processed
	       	  correctly :-)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		3 January 2011
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.0

Notes:		- In "exp_parser.c", in "dalep()", tuned the way stack is
   		  removed.
		- Updated help display (option "-h").
		- Added "-v" option (display version).
		- Fixed a bug in "opcode.c", in "reg_pair()".  That bug
		  can make i8080-as crash.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		4 January 2011
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.0

Notes:		- Now, operand evaluation work correctly on the
		  following instructions:
		  	in	ADDR1 + OFFSET
			out	ADDR1 + OFFSET
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		8 January 2011
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.0

Notes:		- Modified makefiles to be able to built project without
		  using GNU make "-f" option.

		- Now, the following line can be assembled correctly:
		  	db	label_1-label_2

		- Revised/improved "proc_db()" and "proc_dw()", in
		  "asm_dir.c" module.

		- Revised all opcodes processing, and make use of
		  expression parser whenever possible.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		15 January 2011
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.0

Notes:		- In "opcode.c", renamed "reg_pair()" as "parse_reg16bits()".
		- In "opcode.c", modified "parse_reg()" to be able
		  to check if register is allowed.
		- Checked if it is necessary to check if register is
		  allowed in "DestReg()" and "SourceReg().
		  The answer is NO.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		12 February 2011
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.0

Notes:		- Resolved an "if" problem, that appear when more than
		  1 level of "if" are used.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		12 March 2011
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.0

Notes:		- Increased maximum label size from 32 to 64 characters.
		  Seems that 32 characters is not enough long.

		- In "exp_parser.c", in "dalep()", made "label" match
		  the maximum size of a label.  This made problems
		  when using long equate symbols.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		13 March 2011
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.0

Notes:		- Done a general project revision, and cleanup.

		- In main.c, in "do_asm()", made empty source line
		  appearing as single empty line in the listing file,
		  instead of appearing as double empty lines.

		- In main.c, in "do_asm()", made empty source lines always
		  listed as type "LIST_ONLY".  Was not previously always
		  the case.

By:		Jay Cotton

3-23-11:	Autotooled the project to make it more portable to other
		systems.

3-22-11:	Imported changes from Claude Sylvain.
		These changes include but are not limited to:
			Segragate code into functional units.
			Document sections more clearly.
			Fix the expression parser WRT DAL vs RPN parseing.
		A BIG thanks to Claude for his work on this code.

Dark Ages:	Wrote the first version of the code on a weekend and
		put a few fixes into it.   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		26 March 2011
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.1

Notes:		- In ".c" and ".h" modules, update the copyright notice,
   		  since Jay Cotton Email address have changed.
		  Was Jay.Cotton@Sun.COM; and now jay.cotton@oracle.com.
		  Also change year from <2007> to <2007-2011>.

		- Added "-l" option (listing file).

	      	- Added "-o" option (output file).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		27 March 2011
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.1

Notes:		- Made some modification on source files and make files
		  to be able to built on Cygwin, GNU/Linux, Windows, and
		  Solaris (32-bit and 64-bit).
		  But only tested on Cygwin 32-bit and GNU/Linux 32-bit.
		  Notes: Make file in <project>/cygwin/ can both serve to
		  built for Cygwin 32-bit and GNU/Linux 32-bit.

		- In "main.c", in "process_input_file()", removed
	    	  processing of binary file name, because it is done
	  	  elsewhere now.  Also, done some optimizations.

		- In "main.c", in "process_input_file()", if input
		  file name have no extension, assume that the
		  input file name have an ".asm" extension.

		- Started writing a User Manual (i8080asm_um-0.9.1.txt).  

		- Path delimitor at end of path is no more mandatory,
		  when using -I option.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		10 April 2011
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.2

Notes:		- Changed project name as "asm8080" to match the original
		  project name.  Was "i8080-as".

		- Merged my local project with the one in CVS.

		- Resolved some problems in make files.

		- Added doc, src, src_old, test directories.

		- Updated TODO and ChangLog files.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		28 June 2011
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.3

Notes:		- In "main.c", in "PrintList()", improved the listing
		  output.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		26 November 2011
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.4
Notes:		General cleanup.  Removed dead code.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		3 December 2011
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.5

Notes:		- in "asm_dir.c", in "proc_ds()"; "proc_ds()" do not
		  have to process a list of expression, but just
		  one expression.  This was a major bug.
		  Also seems that "proc_ds()" local expression
		  parser had some flaws.
		  That bug was discovered by Jay Cotton, using
		  "als8.asm" module.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		10 December 2011
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.6

Notes:		- Program Counter management improvement.  Now, PC is
		  checked for over range.  This avoid "asm8080" to
		  crash when PC do a roll over, or have an invalid value.

		- Expression parser improvement.  Now, expression parser
		  can handle more levels.

		- Now, can built "test/als8.asm" successfully.

		- Binary object file (.bin) do not have multiple code sections
		  anymore.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		17 December 2011
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.7

Notes:		- Removed "USE_BINARY_HEADER" option and all associated
		  code, because "header" is usually not emmbedded in
		  binary object file.  Futhermore, support of multi-code
		  sections in binary object file have been removed in
		  asm8080 V0.9.6.

		- Added Intel hexadecimal object file support.

		- Updated the user manual (v0.9.4).

		- In "main.c", in "DumpBin()", "LIST_WORDS" was not
		  handled properly (MSB, LSB inverted).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		18 December 2011
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.8

Notes:		- In "asm_dir.c", in "proc_ds()", call "ProcessDumpHex()"
		  and update "target.pc_org" to make "DS" memory
		  section not included in Intel hexadecimal object file.

		- In "main.c", in "ProcessDumpHex()", process
		  "End Of File" record even if there is no data record
		  generated.

		- There was no check on "DS" negative value, and this
		  was making program corrupted without user knowing
		  that problem.

		- In "als8.asm" (the patched version), "OUTP8" and
		  "INP8" was not set correctly, and this make some
		  "DS" directive having negative value.

		- Now, there is no more "roll over" effect applied
		  to "target.pc".  So, filtering must be applied
		  when using "target.pc" to handle properly PC
		  over range condition.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		24 December 2011
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.9

Notes:		- Added "Phasing error" detection.
		- Improved Program Counter management.
		- Improved labels management.

		- Bad code generation when building "als8.asm" test case, was
		  due to misplaced "EQU" ("OUTP8" and "INP8" equate) that
		  was producing phasing errors.
		  Now that asm8080 can detect phasing error, such coding
		  errors can be detected, and bad code generation avoided.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		25 December 2011
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	1.0.0

Notes:		- Label/name processing improvement.
		  Now, labels and names can be distinguish each from
		  other.

		- Lines begining with '$' character seems to contain special
		  assembler directive on some 8080 assemblers.
		  For now, "asm8080" ignore these lines, and just
		  display a warning message.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		26 December 2011
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	1.0.0

Notes:		- Implemented "SET" assembly directive.  Was previously
		  handle as an "EQU".
		- Done "EQU" assembly directive improvement.
		- Done Symbols list improvement.
		- Done Symbols print improvement.
		- Done several tests/corrections using assembly program
	          that can be run on SOL-20 simulator (Solace).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		27 December 2011
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	1.0.0

Notes:		- Symbols table printing improvement.

		- Now, "asm8080" warn user if no file name extension
		  was specified on the input file name.

		- Created "msg.c/h" that provide print messages
	      	  functionnalities; and updated all project modules
	  	  to use these functionnalities.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		28 December 2011
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	1.0.1

Notes:		- Implemented the following operators:
			HIGH
			LOW
			MOD
			SHL
			SHR
			EQ
			LT
			LE
			GT
			GE
			NE
			NOT
			XOR

		- Expression parser improvement.

		- Some "C" like operators are no more supported,
		  because of conflic with assembler special characters.

		- In "project.h", added a conditionnal compilation
		  symbol to be able compile asm8080 without
		  support for "C" like operators.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		29 December 2011
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	1.0.2

Notes:		- Implemented "MACRO", "ENDM" assembly directive.
		  However, macro parameters are not supported, neither
		  "LOCAL" assembler directive.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		30 December 2011
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	1.0.3

Notes:		- In "main.c", in "update_pc()", keep track on the lowest
		  and highest PC value only if not processing "DS"
		  assembly directive.  This is necessary since "DS"
		  modify PC value, and do not generate code.  This avoid
		  binary object file to include "DS" code section.

		- Updated user manual.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		1 January 2012
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	1.0.4

Notes:		- This is the New Year Day, and I updated all the dates on
		  the Copyright notices.

		- Changed the way asm8080 behave when it is called without
	      	  any arguments.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		3 January 2012
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	1.0.4

Notes:		- Fixed a built problem that happen on GNU/Linux.
		  "stdint.h" must be included in "project.h", when
		  building on GNU/Linux computers.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		4 January 2012
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	1.0.4

Notes:		- Moved some "include" that use conditionnal compilation
		  in "project.h", to simplify application maintenance.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		6 January 2012
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	1.0.5

Notes:		- "DW" assembler directive was not working as expected.
		  On single character ('c'), the single character ASCII
		  code was appearing in MSB of the word instead of the
		  LSB.
		  On expression, the value of expression was stored
		  in Big Endian format instead of Little Endian format.
