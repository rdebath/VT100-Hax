Date:		23 December 2010
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		24 December 2010
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.0

	      	- Implemented "ELSE".
		- Created "asm_dir.c/h" and "opcode.c/h" to begin
		  modularization process.
		- Error is displayed when attempting to use 16-bit
		  operand with "IN/OUT".
		- Removed "ENDLOCAL", because this was not implemented,
	     	  and is not a standard Intel 8080 assembler directive.	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		25 December 2010
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.0

Notes:		- Now, there is 2 keywords table.  One for the assembler

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		27 December 2010
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		28 December 2010
By:		Claude Sylvain

By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.0

Notes:		- A "jam" bug resolved in "rpn.c", "extract_byte()".
		- Following problem has been resolved:
			- When an empty source file is included, i8080-as
			  jam.
			- When source file have not and "END" directive,
			  i8080-as jam.

Date:		1 January 2011
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.0

Notes:		- "-I" (Include) option implemented :-)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		2 January 2011
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.0

Notes:		- Renamed "rpn.c/h" module as "exp_parser.c/h", since
		  the expression parser is not a RPN (Reverse Polish Notation)
   		  expression parser, but a DAL (Direct Algebraic Logic)
   		  expression parser.
		- In "exp_parser.c", now, parenthesis are processed
	       	  correctly :-)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		3 January 2011
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.0

Notes:		- In "exp_parser.c", in "dalep()", tuned the way stack is
   		  removed.
		- Updated help display (option "-h").
		- Added "-v" option (display version).
		- Fixed a bug in "opcode.c", in "reg_pair()".  That bug
		  can make i8080-as crash.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		4 January 2011
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.0

Notes:		- Now, operand evaluation work correctly on the
		  following instructions:
		  	in	ADDR1 + OFFSET
			out	ADDR1 + OFFSET
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		8 January 2011
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.0

Notes:		- Modified makefiles to be able to built project without
		  using GNU make "-f" option.

		- Now, the following line can be assembled correctly:
		  	db	label_1-label_2

		- Revised/improved "proc_db()" and "proc_dw()", in
		  "asm_dir.c" module.

		- Revised all opcodes processing, and make use of
		  expression parser whenever possible.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		15 January 2011
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.0

Notes:		- In "opcode.c", renamed "reg_pair()" as "parse_reg16bits()".
		- In "opcode.c", modified "parse_reg()" to be able
		  to check if register is allowed.
		- Checked if it is necessary to check if register is
		  allowed in "DestReg()" and "SourceReg().
		  The answer is NO.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		12 February 2011
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.0

Notes:		- Resolved an "if" problem, that appear when more than
		  1 level of "if" are used.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		12 March 2011
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.0

Notes:		- Increased maximum label size from 32 to 64 characters.
		  Seems that 32 characters is not enough long.

		- In "exp_parser.c", in "dalep()", made "label" match
		  the maximum size of a label.  This made problems
		  when using long equate symbols.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		13 March 2011
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.0

Notes:		- Done a general project revision, and cleanup.

		- In main.c, in "do_asm()", made empty source line
		  appearing as single empty line in the listing file,
		  instead of appearing as double empty lines.

		- In main.c, in "do_asm()", made empty source lines always
		  listed as type "LIST_ONLY".  Was not previously always
		  the case.

3-23-11:	Autotooled the project to make it more portable to other
		systems.

3-22-11:	Imported changes from Claude Sylvain.
		These changes include but are not limited to:
			Segragate code into functional units.
			Document sections more clearly.
			Fix the expression parser WRT DAL vs RPN parseing.
		A BIG thanks to Claude for his work on this code.

Dark Ages:	Wrote the first version of the code on a weekend and
		put a few fixes into it.

Date:		26 March 2011
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.1

Notes:		- In ".c" and ".h" modules, update the copyright notice,
   		  since Jay Cotton Email address have changed.
		  Was Jay.Cotton@Sun.COM; and now jay.cotton@oracle.com.
		  Also change year from <2007> to <2007-2011>.

		- Added "-l" option (listing file).

	      	- Added "-o" option (output file).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date:		27 March 2011
By:		Claude Sylvain
Version:	0.9.1

Notes:		- Made some modification on source files and make files
		  to be able to built on Cygwin, GNU/Linux, Windows, and
		  Solaris (32-bit and 64-bit).
		  But only tested on Cygwin 32-bit and GNU/Linux 32-bit.
		  Notes: Make file in <project>/cygwin/ can both serve to
		  built for Cygwin 32-bit and GNU/Linux 32-bit.

		- In "main.c", in "process_input_file()", removed
	    	  processing of binary file name, because it is done
	  	  elsewhere now.  Also, done some optimizations.

		- In "main.c", in "process_input_file()", if input
		  file name have no extension, assume that the
		  input file name have an ".asm" extension.

		- Started writing a User Manual (i8080asm_um-0.9.1.txt).  

		- Path delimitor at end of path is no more mandatory,
		  when using -I option.

		  project name.  Was "i8080-as".

		- Merged my local project with the one in CVS.

		- Resolved some problems in make files.

		- Added doc, src, src_old, test directories.

		- Updated TODO and ChangLog files.
