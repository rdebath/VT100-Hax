O.k. so here is the deal.

asm8080 os a single pass assember.  This means that if you reference
an identifier that is declared latter in the text, the assembler will
get an error.  So, the todo is to fix the assembler so it will do
multi pass.  This is not as hard as it sounds, but will take a few
days of work.

The Expression parser is slightly schezo, you need to brace all
the expressions, but don't over brace them... in fact the parser
could use work to just make it work better.
