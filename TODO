O.k. so here is the deal.

The Expression parser is slightly schezo, you need to brace all
the expressions, but don't over brace them... in fact the parser
could use work to just make it work better.

Just found that the DS instructions are not generating any 
zeros to use up space.  This will be a big problem, needs to be
fixed.

The DW command can't handle -100 etc.  Real problem
